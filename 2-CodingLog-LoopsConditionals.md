## Challenges & Problem-Solving

### Challenge 1: [Creating a Dataframe]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to return the results of the for loop to a dataframe

**What went wrong:**
I still don't totally know, I'm having trouble getting entries to add to the dataframe from within the loop

**My problem-solving process:**
1. Try it on my own a couple of times: Tries a couple of variations on adding headings to the dataframe, turning the data itself into a dataframe, copying it all into a dataframe and then removing
2. Consulted the documentation for dataframes and found the rbind command, but kept throwing errors
3. Followed along as it was brought up in class, the solution I landed on was the expected one, but no one else could figure out how it worked either

**Resources I consulted:**
- [X] Documentation for dataframe
- [] Stack Overflow
- [X] Course materials: earlier in worksheet 3 ot make sure I was filtering correctly
- [X] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
Hasn't been resolved yet, I think I have all the parts but I need to explore further into how adding to empty dataframes works

**What I learned:**
Didn't know dataframes existed in R so I learned that, as well as how to theoretically add to them

### Challenge 2: [gayguides filtering]

**What I was trying to do:**
I was trying to filter the gayguides dataset by checking if each entry was located in the city of greenville

**What went wrong:**
I couldn't figure out how to check a specific column of a specific row, the syntax was just giving me trouble

**My problem-solving process:**
1. Tried a couple of variations of moving the brackets around the way I did last week, but without success
2. Looked up a similar problem and found that there were a couple of different ways to structure the syntax, but I wasn't fully doing any of them
3. Tried those methods until I could choose one that felt comfortable to do the rest of the worksheet with

**Resources I consulted:**
- [X] Documentation for [segmentation]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [X] Course materials: Class example
- [X] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
I eventually started using [i, ] in my for loops to indicate a specific row, and that allowed me to choose a specific column in the way I was used to

**What I learned:**
Some problems have a lot of solutions, but sometimes you need to look them up or you'll end up with a mismash of all of them that doesn't have the functionality of any of them

### Challenge 3 (Optional): [Brief descriptive title]

**What I was trying to do:**
[Describe the task or problem]

**What went wrong:**
[Describe the error, confusion, or roadblock]

**My problem-solving process:**
1. [First attempt - what you did and what happened]
2. [Second attempt - what you did and what happened]
3. [Additional attempts if relevant]

**Resources I consulted:**
- [ ] Documentation for [package/function]
- [ ] Stack Overflow: [describe what you searched for]
- [ ] Course materials: [which ones]
- [ ] Slack discussion
- [ ] Office hours
- [ ] Other: [describe]

**Resolution:**
[What ultimately worked or where you're still stuck]

**What I learned:**
[What did this teach you about the concept, the tool, or problem-solving?]

## Reflection

**What I understand well now:**
I understand conditionals, loops, and functions and specifically how the syntax for those things is adapted in R as opposed to something like C

**What I'm still confused about:**
Still having some issues with the dataframe problem. I'd like to eventually fix that since I really like working with dataframes in python

**Connection to historical research:**
Conditionals and loops are a great way to check a bunch of records and do different things with them based on certain criteria, which is great for filtering or moving data around folders. Also combines with search functions to let you automatically attatch actions to search criteria.
